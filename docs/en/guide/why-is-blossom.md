## What is BlossomÔºü {#what-is-blossom}

Blossom is a note-taking software that requires private deployment. Although it is positioned as a cloud-based application, you can still deploy it locally, ensuring that data and images are stored on your device without relying on any external image hosting or object storage.

## Why is BlossomÔºü {#why-is-blossom}

As an open-source software, Blossom has no intention, nor capability, to compete with mature note-taking software in the market. It simply offers a new choice.

### Special pages {#special-page}

Blossom has not adopted a software layout and page design similar to Notion because there are already many software with similar interfaces in the market. If you're feeling aesthetically fatigued with these software, perhaps you can give Blossom a try.

### Comprehensive file relationships {#references}

When using certain software, especially those from public cloud providers, you may encounter the following frustrating scenarios:

1. I have many images, but I don't know if they are in use. I want to delete them, but I'm afraid to do so.
2. One image is used in multiple articles. When the image needs an update, I have to modify each article separately.
3. I accidentally deleted an image, causing issues with the display of my articles. Retrieving the image is a difficult and cumbersome process.
4. Which images have I uploaded and used? I wish there was a gallery-like feature to view and manage them.

If you have these concerns, perhaps you can give Blossom a try. Blossom offers comprehensive **image management**Ôºå**protection against accidental deletion**Ôºåand **bidirectional linking between images and articles**.You can easily see which articles use specific images and replace them with just one click.

### Quick Migration {#easy-transfer}

All images are independent of any third-party image hosting and storage. They are only stored on the deployed device ; You can write in [Markdown](./markdown) with non-destructive syntax extensions,content created here can be displayed correctly in any Markdown software.

All images and articles support one-click [backup and export](./article#backup),making migration easy within minutes. The exported files can seamlessly be opened with local software like VS Code or Obsidian.

## Blossom Development Story üìù {#story}

Blossom wrote its first line of code on June 10, 2023, and released version `v1.0.0` on August 10, 2023. The development has continued since then.

The author initially used Evernote and later switched to using IntelliJ IDEA to record notes and code around 2017-2018. Around 2019, the author felt the need to write blogs and, at the same time, started developing note-taking software due to learning some frontend knowledge. This software can also be considered as the predecessor of Blossom.

However, due to limited skills at that time and issues with dual-screen scrolling synchronization in [editor.md](https://github.com/pandao/editor.md), the editing of articles was always awkward.

Later on, Yuque gained popularity, endorsed by Ant Financial, led by Evan You (also known as Yu), and equipped with an excellent self-developed rich-text editor, making it a rare excellent domestic note-taking software. The author started migrating their notes to Yuque and developed a [blog](https://gitee.com/jasminexz/open-blog) based on Yuque's API.

This was actually the predecessor of the Blossom blog.

After using Yuque for two to three years, everything seemed perfect until the end of 2022 when Yuque started limiting the number of documents for free users and restricting public sharing. Even in the initial pricing plan, dark mode required a membership to use. This led to a wave of hot searches about Yuque, and Evan You had to urgently modify the pricing model.

In fact, it's normal for commercial software to charge fees as there are significant costs involved in storage space, network bandwidth, and the review process for public access. However, within less than half a year of charging, Evan You resigned, and at that time, I felt that Yuque might be abandoned. Charging seemed to be the last chance given by Ant Financial to Yuque.

So, I decided to migrate my notes once again,
